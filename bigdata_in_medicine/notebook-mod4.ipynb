    "In this course, you are not required to become proficient in writing R scripts for Big Biomedical Data Analytics. The assignments will be based on each module's template, and replacing some parts of them with new data and parameters so that you will get new results and interpret them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding all the coding details in R will depend on your bakcground knowledge in programming concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore if you do not understand all the coding details in R, try to run the code and understand mostly: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) what information do I have to provide to this script to make it work ?\n",
    "\n",
    "2) how to execute this script (it will always be: run the cell containing the script Cell --> Run cells, or click on SHIFT + ENTER at the same time, or simply click on the right arrow icon) ?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) what results do I get ?\n",
    "\n",
    "4) how to interpret the results ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Little by little, you will become familiar with R programming language and, example after example, you will understand the scripts and be ready for more advanced programming work. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you are going to practice classification / prediction with R scripts, and particularly prediction based on gene expressions. This implies some data preprocessing then building a classification / prediction model to predict a disease (for example, this same process could be applied to different types of prediction).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are continuing to work on a breast cancer dataset downloaded from Firehose (https://gdac.broadinstitute.org/). These are next generation sequencing data that are provided already normalized. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to compare two classifiers - KNN (K-nearest neighbor) and RandomForest (a classifier in the rule / tree family).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time we are going to build the models on the top 100 genes selected through bss/wss in Module 3, once using the training set as a test set (most favorable scenario), and next using the training set as 70% of the whole dataset, and the test set as 30% (least favorable scenario). We expect the classification accuracy to drop when moving from testing on the training set and training on 70% of the data. But how much is the accuracy goin to drop ? And which of the two models is going to perform the best ? These are the questions we will try and answer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So let us get started !\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The processes employed to build the predictive model use quite a bit of RAM memory, therefore we first allocate this memory by increasaing the program memory size to 3.5GB (= 3,500 MB). We also load some libraries used for analysis - 'class' and 'randomForest'."
